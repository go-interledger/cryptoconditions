# cryptoconditions

<<<<<<< HEAD
This package provides a Go (golang) implementation of the 
[Crypto-Conditions specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions/)
intended for the Interledger protocol.
=======


## Differences with InterledgerJs

 - Fulfillment objects are immutable,
 except for the `ParsePayload` method.
 - No validation of conditions against local rules 
 (js's `condition.validate`).
